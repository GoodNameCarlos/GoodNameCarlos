- 👁 👄 👁 I'm interested in learning how to use R, RStudio, Python, Git and more programming software that can help me in research. 
           My main focus in academia is aging, aging successfully and/or healthy, Psychological well being, mental health and Statistics.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learninng how to use R and Git, althought I consider that I have a good grasp on R.
